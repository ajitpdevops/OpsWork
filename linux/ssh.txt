Generating a new SSH key
Open Git Bash.

Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
This creates a new SSH key, using the provided email as a label.
> Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

> Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_ed25519):[Press enter]
At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases."

> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]


## TESTING YOUR SSH CONNECTION 
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection

Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.

Enter the following:

$ ssh -T git@github.com
# Attempts to ssh to GitHub
You may see a warning like this:

> The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
> RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
Verify that the fingerprint in the message you see matches GitHub's RSA public key fingerprint. If it does, then type yes:

> Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
> provide shell access.
You may see this error message:

...
Agent admitted failure to sign using the key.
debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
Permission denied (publickey).
This is a known problem with certain Linux distributions. For more information, see "Error: Agent admitted failure to sign".

Verify that the resulting message contains your username. If you receive a "permission denied" message, see "Error: Permission denied (publickey)".
