## Invoke python script on a remote linux machine from jenkins agent    
    	
There are a few different ways you can execute a Python script on a Linux machine remotely from a Jenkins slave on a Windows machine:

1. Use SSH: You can use the SSH protocol to securely connect to the Linux machine and execute the Python script remotely. To do this, you'll need to have an SSH client installed on the Windows machine (e.g. PuTTY or OpenSSH) and an SSH server running on the Linux machine.

2. Use a tool like WinSCP: WinSCP is a free and open-source tool that allows you to securely transfer files between a Windows machine and a Linux machine using the SCP (Secure Copy) protocol. You can use WinSCP to copy your Python script to the Linux machine, and then use a remote execution tool like sshpass or plink to execute the script on the Linux machine.

3. Use a Jenkins plugin: There are several Jenkins plugins available that allow you to execute commands on remote machines, including the SSH Pipeline Steps plugin and the Remote Execution plugin. These plugins provide a set of pipeline steps that allow you to securely connect to a remote machine and execute commands or scripts.

Regardless of which approach you choose, it's important to ensure that you're using secure authentication and encryption methods to protect your credentials and data. For example, you should use strong passwords, enable SSH key-based authentication, and use encrypted communication protocols like SSH or SCP.

## Example of how to use the SSH Pipeline Steps plugin to execute a Python script on a remote Linux machine from a Jenkins slave running on a Windows machine.

Firdtly, you'll need to install the SSH Pipeline Steps plugin on your Jenkins instance. You can do this by going to the "Manage Jenkins" page, selecting "Manage Plugins", and searching for "SSH Pipeline Steps" in the "Available" tab.
        
    node('windows-slave') {
        stage('Execute Python Script') {
            sshScript remote: [
                host: 'linux-server.example.com',
                user: 'username',
                password: env.LINUX_PASSWORD // use environment variable to secure password
            ], script: '''
                cd /path/to/python/script
                python myscript.py
            '''
        }
    }

We can also use the sshCommand step to execute a single command on the remote machine, rather than a script. For example:
        
    sshCommand remote: [
        host: 'linux-server.example.com',
        user: 'username',
        password: env.LINUX_PASSWORD
    ], command: 'ls -l /path/to/files'


## How to use different jenkins agent machines to perform different steps of pipeline
    pipeline {
        agent none
        stages {
            stage('Build') {
                agent {
                    label 'windows-agent'
                }
                steps {
                    // Run build steps on Windows agent
                }
            }
            stage('Test') {
                agent {
                    label 'linux-agent'
                }
                steps {
                    // Run test steps on Linux agent
                }
            }
            stage('Deploy') {
                agent {
                    label 'windows-agent'
                }
                steps {
                    // Deploy artifacts on Windows agent
                }
            }
        }
    }
